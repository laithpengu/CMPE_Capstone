- **Scope**: We are the ICS processor team. ICS, the Intelligent Convoy System, allows one leader vehicle to have autonomous vehicles follow with active obstacle avoidance. 
- **Schedule**: We're on schedule, finalizing some modules and prepping for demo/PDR
- **Spending**: Spending has not changed since our last standup, which stands at $66.95 spent between FPGA addons and an RC Car controller
- **Stakeholders**: Our current stakeholder is Dr. LaBerge
- **Status**: We're running and creating testbenches for our FPGA modules as well as beginning PDR work
- **Specifics**: The functionality of our RF module is complete and testing is going to be completed next. We're looking into using UART to display data from our FPGA to a monitor to demonstrate how data moves through the system. We've also begun working on the hardware for our controller, and need to look more into battery placement on the vehicle, may not be top priority right now.
