# HDL Code Information
- This folder holds (for now) deprecated HDL code as we are going for the arduino approach
- Each folder holds the components or multiple subcomponents we planned on using for the full processor architecture.
- Each folder (should) have:
    - doc: documentation on how the module works and how to use it
    - sim: Simulation tcl scripts
    - src: module file(s)
    - synth: constraint file and synth tcl script
    - test: testbench for the module
