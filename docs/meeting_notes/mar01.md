# March 1st meeting
## Status Update (Avoidance)
- Has microblaze setup with basic GPIO pins working
- Can turn on light proving they can use the board
- Had a couple hiccups along the way but is ready to apply what they have
- Still not sure about how we setup the pins
- Been waiting on microblaze to be ready to test the algorithm
- Gonna get a gyroscope
## Status Update (Processor)
- Agoda kedina. A carba babajunu conjuju munu caba?
- Will give avoidance the ranges of the angle
- Believe rx is done, then just gotta test it
- After that works should be able to quickly write tx and get that working
- All peripheral modules are pretty much, just need control logic done
- Want to setup test today to have avoidance test changing the breadcrumb and print it to UART
